## React Fundamental Concepts Used

The following React fundamentals were used in this project:

1. **Handling data from nested components by props drilling**
2. **useState** for state management
3. **Context API** for global state management
4. **React Components** for building reusable UI elements

## Data Handling and Management

For handling and managing data, we utilized the **Context API** for global state management and used **localStorage** to persist user data (like cart items and wishlist) across sessions.

## Features

Here are the main features of the website:

1. **Showing Product by Tab** - Products are organized and displayed by tabs for easy browsing.
2. **Add to Cart Feature** - Users can add products to their cart and review them at any time.
3. **Wishlist Feature** - Users can add products to their wishlist and purchase them later.
4. **Showing Added Items in Cart and Wishlist** - Customers can view all items added to the cart and wishlist on separate pages.
5. **Sort by Price in Descending Order on Cart Page** - Products in the cart can be sorted by price from high to low.
6. **Purchase System on Cart Page** - The cart page allows users to complete their purchase securely.
